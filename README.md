## Super Cream 64 - The Grand Finale 
A fork of [AloXado320/sm64ex-alo](https://github.com/AloXado320/sm64ex-alo), which is a fork of [sm64pc/sm64ex](https://github.com/sm64pc/sm64ex) with additional features. 

Overall additions since the last build:

 * Flying finally added! - Since introduced in Chao Bandstand, you can now fly around in the base game
 * Outfits galore - All the outfits are all available here alongside a few new ones to boot! Cheese also gets in on the fun with matching alts!
 * New levels - Three new areas have been added, replacing Secret Aquarium, Vanish Cap Under the Moat and Wing Mario over the Rainbow. 
 * Redone soundtrack - While mostly the same as before, more songs have been added and redone to help with file size. 
 * And much more!
 
 ## Building SC64
 
 If you haven't built with the normal sm64ex/sm64ex-alo builds, look at those first for a proper tutorial. Then come back here. 
 
 1) do ```git clone https://github.com/Gamebunn/sm64ex-alo.git``` to somewhere on your PC.
 2) download the extra assets needed for the repo. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PnNohUtrKLahcUObhSvOFsZF4So9gTZ0/view?usp=sharing
 3) dump the contents of the repo folder into the root of where you cloned the git
 4) go ahead and compile.
 
 Helpful build additions:
 
 HIGH_FPS_PC=1 - Game runs at 60 FPS
 
 NODRAWINGDISTANCE=1 - All objects are shown at all times

## Building
 ### Clone the repository:

 ```sh
 git clone https://github.com/AloXado320/sm64ex-alo
 cd sm64ex-alo
 ```
 
 **Note:** On Unix systems you may need to do this before doing any changes:
 
 ```sh
 git config core.fileMode false
 chmod -R 777 .
 ```
 
 ### Copy baserom(s) for asset extraction:
 
 For each version (jp/us/eu/sh) for which you want to build an executable, put an existing ROM at `./baserom.<VERSION>.z64` for asset extraction.
 
 By default it builds the US version.
