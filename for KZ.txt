Game will just launch by opening the exe file. It generates a config file in appdata/roaming/sm64ex that you can delete in case something goes wrong.

Things to note:

Some star rings will look transparant even when you never collected them. It's a visual bug. They should still work just fine.

You'll just do the water star dance when getting certain stars. Also a visual bug and no idea why.

AVOID THE PILLARS IN JRB. I also stuck in an in-game warning just in case. 

Something I noticed in Kris' stream: When you get the star in the first eggman stage, it'll lock you in the key camera for when you normally beat bowser and I think your movement is limited. No idea if it's just an issue with the new camera or something I missed but try to exit level or somehow wiggle your way to the warp ring to reset the camera when you start the eggman fight. 

Aside from those, everything should be fine. Also stuck in a save file that has all the star rings just in case you choose not to bother with that.
